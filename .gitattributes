# Keep large model artifacts on LFS, but allow small runtime models as normal Git files
# Previously: *.pkl filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Track only large PKL models in LFS (examples below)

# Do NOT LFS-track these small runtime artifacts (left unlisted here):

# - models/feature_names.pkl

# Still track big CSVs via LFS if needed
