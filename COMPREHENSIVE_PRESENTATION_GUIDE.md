## ❓ Anticipated Cross-Questions & Detailed Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do you handle market regimes and black swan events?**
A: "Our model includes VIX and volatility features that capture market stress. While no model predicts black swans, our ensemble approach and feature diversity provide robustness. We implement dynamic confidence scoring that decreases during high-volatility periods."

**Q: What about survivorship bias in your stock selection?**
A: "We used S&P 500 constituents as of our data collection date, which could introduce survivorship bias. In production, we'd include delisted stocks and implement dynamic universe updates to address this limitation."

**Q: How do you validate that features aren't causing data leakage?**
A: "All features use only historical data up to the prediction date. Our lagged features explicitly shift data by N days. We use time-series splits and walk-forward validation to ensure no future information contaminates predictions."

**Q: Why not use deep learning exclusively given its recent success?**
A: "Deep learning excels with unstructured data (images, text), but financial tabular data with engineered features often performs better with ensemble methods. Random Forest provides interpretability, faster training, and comparable accuracy for our use case."

### Business Questions

**Q: How would this perform in different market conditions (bull vs bear markets)?**
A: "Our 5-year training period includes both bull (2019-2021) and bear (2022) markets. The model learns different regime patterns through macro features. However, extended validation across multiple market cycles would strengthen confidence."

**Q: What are the regulatory considerations for algorithmic trading?**
A: "Algorithmic trading faces regulations like market making requirements, circuit breakers, and audit trails. Our system provides transparency through feature importance and prediction confidence scores, supporting compliance requirements."

**Q: How do you measure and control portfolio risk?**
A: "We implement position sizing based on volatility forecasts, maximum drawdown limits, and correlation analysis across holdings. The backtesting framework includes risk metrics like VaR and Sharpe ratio calculation."

### Implementation Questions

**Q: How do you handle model degradation over time?**
A: "We implement model monitoring comparing prediction accuracy to actual outcomes. When performance drops below thresholds, automated retraining triggers using recent data. A/B testing framework compares new models against production versions."

**Q: What's your approach to feature selection and dimensionality reduction?**
A: "Random Forest provides natural feature importance ranking. We monitor feature stability and predictive power over time. While we could use PCA or other dimensionality reduction, Random Forest handles high-dimensional data effectively without preprocessing."

**Q: How do you ensure reproducibility in your machine learning pipeline?**
A: "All models use fixed random seeds, versioned datasets, and containerized environments. Our feature engineering pipeline is deterministic, and we maintain detailed logging of model parameters and training procedures."
